# Skyblock Collection Tracker Mod!
# The server is down for now so no one can actually use the mod! I'm sorry for the inconveniences!
Massive thanks to nea89 for the wiki! It taught me a lot about minecraft modding.

## Features: 
- Tracks your skyblock collections!
  - for now it only tracks mining collections like gold or gemstones
- Run: /sct help for all commands
- Shows the collection, as well as how much you gain/h
  - The gui is inspired by [Ninjune's coleweight mod](https://www.chattriggers.com/modules/v/Coleweight) (since his collection tracker is 'broken')
