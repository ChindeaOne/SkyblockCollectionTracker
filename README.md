## Features: 
- Tracks your skyblock collections!
  - for now it only tracks mining collections like gold or gemstones
  - ~~you need to set your api key from https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard~~
  - not the case anymore, but being still in development i don't have a lot of requests for the key
