# Skyblock Collection Tracker Mod!
Massive thanks to nea89 for the [wiki](https://moddev.nea.moe), to Ninjune for the inspiration, to Moulberry for the [MoulConfig](https://notenoughupdates.org/MoulConfig/) library and to hannibal2 for the [Skyhanni](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni) mod from where i got ideas.

## Features: 
- Tracks your skyblock collections!
  - for now it only tracks mining collections like gold or gemstones
- Run: /sct help for all commands
- Shows the collection, as well as how much you gain/h
  - The gui for the tracker is inspired by [Ninjune's coleweight mod](https://www.chattriggers.com/modules/v/Coleweight) (since his collection tracker is 'broken')
